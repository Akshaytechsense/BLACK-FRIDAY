# BLACK-FRIDAY
🛍️ Black Friday Sales Dataset - EDA & Feature Engineering
📌 Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the Black Friday sales dataset. The primary goal is to clean, understand, and prepare the data for predictive modeling, uncovering patterns in customer purchases based on demographics and product categories.

🧾 Problem Statement
The dataset contains anonymized data on customer purchases during a Black Friday sale. Our goal is to analyze spending behavior and engineer meaningful features that can later help build a predictive model to estimate purchase amounts.

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

User and Product IDs

Gender, Age group, Occupation, City Category

Duration of stay in the current city

Marital Status

Product Categories

Purchase amount

🔍 Key Steps and Insights
🧹 Data Cleaning: Handled missing values in Product_Category_2 and Product_Category_3.

📊 EDA:

Analyzed gender-wise and age-wise purchase patterns.

Explored product categories and their popularity.

Investigated city-based trends in spending behavior.

🛠️ Feature Engineering:

Created new meaningful variables for modeling (e.g., total product category count, encoded city and age features).

🧠 Model Prep:

Prepared data for training ML models to predict purchase amounts.

📈 Visualizations
Bar plots for gender, occupation, age vs. purchase.

Histograms for product category distributions.

Correlation matrix to explore feature relationships.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for encoding and future model prep)

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload the Black Friday dataset.

Run the notebook cells step-by-step for complete analysis and feature transformation.

💡 Business Value
This analysis helps:

Understand consumer segments and purchasing behavior.

Optimize marketing strategies based on demographics.

Prepare robust data for machine learning pipelines.
